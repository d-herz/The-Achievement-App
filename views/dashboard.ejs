        Various error messages can be displayed here. For example, if the Steam API key is missing,
        or if the user's steam profile isn't set to public in order to let them know how to fix potentially
        empty game results despite logging in (until we think of a better way to go about this).

                In this case, we can just skip trying to attach those icons.
